/*
(Picking a card) Write a program that simulates the action of picking a card from a deck of 52 cards. Your program
displays the suit and rank of the card. Here are sample runs:

<output>
The card is 10 of Spades
<end output>

<output>
The card is Jack of Clubs
<end output>

Hint: Consider the cards are random numbers from 0 to 51. Card numbers 0 to 12, 13 to 25, 26 to 38, and 39 to 51
represent 13 Spades, 13 Hearts, 13 Diamonds, and 13 Clubs, respectively. cardNumber / 13 determines the suit of the
card and cardNumber % 13 determines the rank of the card. Obtain a random number from 0 to 51 and display its rank
and suit. (Students can write this program in Chapter 3. Later in Chapter 7, the program can be simplified using arrays.)
